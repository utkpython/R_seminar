# R is awesome for experimenting with numbers
# you can use it like a calculator
# type the following lines in the console window within RStudio

1 + 1

11 / 3

111 / 3 + 3

sqrt(1/3)

log(1/3)


# you can store numbers so that you don't have to type them again
# read the following as "my_number" is assigned to be the square root of 111/3
my_number <- sqrt(111/3)

my_number + 1000

# if you don't like my_number, you can reassign it

my_number <- 7  # after all, 7 is lucky





# it is also fun to ask R questions
# for example, what is the sum of integers between 1 and 100?
# here's one way to do this

sum(1:100)  # read it as: "give me the sum of the numbers 1 to 100
